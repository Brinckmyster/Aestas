It integrates an **AI Protocol Editor** in the Admin panel—by default using Perplexity Labs, but designed to support any compatible AI provider (such as Hugging Face, OpenRouter, Ollama, etc.). The AI panel is "plug-and-play": you can swap out the AI backend by updating the API endpoint in the code, making it flexible for future needs or institutional requirements.
