## Overview

Academic Allies is a customizable web app for students with disabilities and their support network.  
It integrates **Perplexity Labs** so Admins can live-edit care protocols without redeploying code.

## Features

- Student Dashboard: status circle, daily check-ins, logs (list/chart/calendar), calendar integration, emergency contacts.  
- Admin Panel: user/role management and live protocol editing via Labs.  
- Labs Mode: deep research, code execution, file generation, mini-app deployment in-app.

## Labs Integration

2. Assets tab: View/download HTML, CSS, JS, charts, CSVs, images  
3. App tab: Preview mini-apps built by Labs  
4. Protocol Editor: textarea + ‚ÄúRun Labs‚Äù ‚Üí Perplexity Labs API  
5. Audit trail: timestamped log of every Labs change
