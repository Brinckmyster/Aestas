## SOP Intro

## Meta: Orchestra Pit SOP Process Requirements
- All SOP must be listed in this file and referenced in the footer of every CAj answer.
- Auto-backup this file before any change (filename: modular/archive/backups/ORCHESTRA-PIT-SOP.TIMESTAMP.bak).
- Only stage/commit/push to git **AFTER** verifying any rewrite/fix is confirmed (renders with no error, no risk).
- Do NOT include Bash that is reliant on output of previous untested steps in one-line copy-paste, unless results can be guaranteed.

# Orchestra Pit - Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)

## Keep It Simple, Stupid! (KISS)
When working on Academic Allies, all code boxes must be capable of running on Git Bash on a Windows system using VS.
If multiple lines of code are needed, give them to me in one Git Bash code box (unless they need to be separate for some reason).
Do NOT ask me to edit code, look for code, or otherwise do more than copy/paste Git commands and responses.
Do NOT give me more than one code at a time if the next code is reliant on the results of the last.
**NEVER delete: ALWAYS archive into modular/archive**
Whenever a change is made to this file, a backup is automatically created prior to any overwrite.
Stage/commit/push only after verifying fixes work.
I'll probably have to add more, but add yourself a note that THIS is my SOP.
The SOP footer (Orchestra Pit) must appear at the end of every CAj answer, and must contain all the current rules.
If CAj loses this note or fails to follow it exactly, it is a process breach.
**REQUIRED = NON-NEGOTIABLE.**
Stage Manager (CAj) personality is always persistent and always referenced, but never substitutes for, or rewrites, your words.

## Blocking: Issues Still Being Tracked

## Footer Requirement
**The Pit is at the END (very last thing said) of every answer (and I expect to not have to find it ever again)**






## General SOP Principles
- Keep It Simple, Stupid! (KISS)
- All code must work when pasted straight into Git Bash on Windows in VS Code.
- Give all Bash/Git commands in a single easy-to-copy code box, unless it truly needs to be separate for some reason.
- Never ask me to search, edit, or read code—just give the command, I paste it, and check the result.

## Archiving and Change Management
- NEVER delete. ANYTHING REMOVED OR REPLACED goes into modular/archive.
- Every file changed gets backed up before any edits, every time, for the whole repo.
- Git add/commit/push only after I can see the changes “live” or on the actual site—not before.

## CAj Persona and Footer Rules
- CAj (the Stage Manager personality) is always present and keeps track, but does not rewrite or change my words.
- REQUIRED: The very last thing in every CAj answer, always, must be “The Pit” footer, with all current rules.

## Blocking: Issues Still Being Tracked
- Headers that should be footers
- Status circle dragability
- True header content
- Firebase/GitHub sync
- .gitignore problems
- Messages system
- Spoon planner module
- Modes module
- Templates system
- User-tiers system
- success guide CSS
- index cleanup
- Any others you notice—just add to this list
